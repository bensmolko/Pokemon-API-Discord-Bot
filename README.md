# Pokemon-API-Discord-Bot

This project is one of the less meaningful programs I have written, but I still thought I'd select this project to add to this repository, as I wanted to showcase the diversity of the discord projects that I have worked on. I have a lot of other discord bots that don't serve a significant purpose -- much like this one --  but I still thoroughly enjoy making them. This program queries a Pokemon API to generate various data points about a specific Pokemon, such as weight, height, abilities, type, and image. This program, along with many other small discord bots that I have made in the past, stemmed from my fascination with APIs(application programming interfaces). Ever since I began my programming journey, I have always been curious about how my programs can interact with others. By querying an API and parsing through the data to serve the user digestible information about a topic they are interested in, I thought this was a great way to break into real-world interaction through my code.
